## **Introduction to Software Testing**

### **1. What is Software Testing?**

- **Definition:** Software testing is the process of evaluating and verifying that a software application or system meets specified requirements and is free of defects. It involves executing the software to ensure it behaves as expected.
- **Purpose:** To identify bugs or issues, ensure the software works as intended, and improve its quality and performance.
- **Types:** Includes functional testing, non-functional testing, manual testing, and automated testing.

**Example:** Testing a login feature to ensure users can correctly log in with valid credentials and are denied access with invalid credentials.

### **2. Importance of Testing in Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**

- **Early Detection of Defects:** Testing helps in identifying and fixing issues early in the development cycle, reducing costs and effort.
- **Improves Quality:** Ensures the software meets the required standards and functions correctly in all intended environments.
- **Customer Satisfaction:** Delivers a reliable and user-friendly product, which increases user trust and satisfaction.
- **Risk Management:** Helps in mitigating risks associated with software failure or defects.

**Example:** Testing an e-commerce application before launch ensures that payment processing is secure and orders are processed correctly, preventing potential financial losses or customer dissatisfaction.

### **3. Understanding Software Testing Life Cycle (STLC)**

- **Phases:**
    - **Requirement Analysis:** Understand the requirements to create test cases.
    - **Test Planning:** Define the scope, approach, resources, and schedule for testing.
    - **Test Design:** Create and document test cases and scripts.
    - **Test Execution:** Execute the test cases and document the results.
    - **Defect Reporting:** Identify and report defects.
    - **Test Closure:** Evaluate cycle completion criteria, assess test coverage, and finalize testing documents.

**Example:** In a project, during the Test Planning phase, you might define a test strategy for a new feature, decide on the testing tools, and estimate the effort required.

### **4. Difference between SDLC and STLC**

- **SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle):**
    - **Focus:** Entire process of software development from planning to deployment.
    - **Phases:** Includes stages like requirement analysis, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
    - **Purpose:** To manage the development of software products through a structured approach.
- **STLC (Software Testing Life Cycle):**
    - **Focus:** Specific to the testing phase of the software development process.
    - **Phases:** Includes stages like requirement analysis, test planning, test design, test execution, defect reporting, and test closure.
    - **Purpose:** To ensure the software meets quality standards through systematic testing.

**Example:** While SDLC encompasses the whole process of building a software application, STLC focuses specifically on the testing part to ensure quality within that process.

- **Definition:** Black-box testing involves testing the software without any knowledge of its internal code structure or implementation. Testers focus on inputs and expected outputs.
- **Approach:** Tests are designed based on requirements and specifications.

**Example:** Testing a search feature by inputting various search terms and checking if the results are correct without knowing how the search function is implemented.

### **2. Advantages and Disadvantages of Black-Box Testing**

- **Advantages:**
    - **No Need for Code Knowledge:** Testers do not need to understand the internal workings of the application.
    - **User-Focused:** Tests are based on user requirements, which helps ensure the application meets user needs.
    - **Effective for Functional Testing:** Ideal for validating the functionality of the software.
- **Disadvantages:**
    - **Limited Coverage:** Only functional aspects are tested; internal paths or structures are not considered.
    - **Difficulty in Identifying Issues:** Can be challenging to trace the source of defects as the internal code is not examined.
    - **Redundancy:** May result in redundant tests if the same functionality is tested from different angles.

**Example:** Testing a login form’s functionality might involve checking valid and invalid credentials, but it won’t reveal how the login algorithm works internally.

### **3. Introduction to White-Box Testing**

- **Definition:** White-box testing, also known as clear-box or glass-box testing, involves testing the software with knowledge of its internal code and logic. Testers examine the code structure, algorithms, and internal workings.
- **Approach:** Tests are designed based on code logic and structure.

**Example:** Testing the logic of an algorithm by writing test cases that cover different branches of the code, such as different paths in a decision-making process.

## **Unit Testing**

### **1. Understanding Unit Testing**

- **Definition:** Unit testing involves testing individual units or components of code in isolation to ensure they work correctly. A "unit" typically refers to the smallest testable part of the application, such as a function or method.
- **Purpose:** To validate that each unit of code functions as intended, identify defects early in development, and facilitate changes by ensuring existing functionality remains intact.

**Example:** Testing a function that calculates the total price of items in a shopping cart to verify it returns the correct value for different item quantities.

### **2. Best Practices for Unit Testing**

- **Write Tests Early:** Develop unit tests alongside code to catch issues early and ensure continuous verification.
- **Keep Tests Small and Focused:** Each test should cover a single functionality or behavior to make them easier to understand and maintain.
- **Use Descriptive Names:** Name test methods clearly to indicate what functionality or behavior they are verifying.
- **Isolate Units:** Test units in isolation from dependencies using stubs or mocks to avoid external factors influencing the test results.
- **Ensure Test Coverage:** Aim for comprehensive test coverage but focus on critical paths and business logic.
- **Automate Tests:** Integrate unit tests into your build process to run automatically and provide quick feedback.

**Example:** Instead of writing one large test method that covers multiple functionalities, create separate tests for each functionality, like verifying calculation accuracy and handling of edge cases.

### **3. Common Pitfalls to Avoid in Unit Testing**

- **Over-Mocking:** Excessive use of mocks can lead to fragile tests that break with minor changes. Use mocks judiciously and prefer integration testing for complex interactions.
- **Testing Implementation Details:** Focus on testing behavior rather than internal implementation details, which can lead to brittle tests.
- **Neglecting Edge Cases:** Ensure tests cover edge cases and not just the "happy path" to avoid missing potential issues.
- **Ignoring Test Failures:** Address failing tests promptly instead of ignoring them, as they indicate problems that need resolution.

**Example:** If a unit test fails due to an incorrect implementation detail, refactor the test to focus on the expected behavior rather than the code structure.

### **4. Unit Testing Tools**

- **JUnit:** A popular testing framework for Java that provides annotations, assertions, and test runners.
- **NUnit:** A unit testing framework for .NET languages with similar features to JUnit.
- **pytest:** A testing framework for Python that supports fixtures, parameterized tests, and easy integration.

**Example:** Using JUnit to write and run unit tests for a Java application, including setting up test cases and validating expected outcomes.

### **5. Stub vs. Mock**

- **Stub:** A stub is a simple implementation of an interface or method used to provide controlled responses to method calls. Stubs are used to isolate the unit under test from dependencies.
    - **Example:** A stub might return a fixed value for a database query method to simulate database interactions without connecting to an actual database.
- **Mock:** A mock is an object that verifies interactions with a unit under test. Mocks can check if specific methods are called with particular arguments and in what order.
    - **Example:** A mock might verify that a logging method is called when an error occurs in a service.

### **6. Parameterized Unit Testing**

- **Definition:** Parameterized unit testing involves running the same test with different sets of input data to verify the behavior of the unit under various conditions.
- **Purpose:** To ensure that the unit behaves correctly with a range of inputs and edge cases.
- **Implementation:** Use test frameworks that support parameterization, such as JUnit’s `@ParameterizedTest` annotation or pytest’s `@pytest.mark.parametrize` decorator.

**Example:** Testing a function that determines if a number is prime with different numbers to ensure it handles all cases correctly.

### **7. Testing Private Methods**

- **Definition:** Private methods are those that are not directly accessible from outside the class or module.
- **Approach:** Typically, private methods are tested indirectly through public methods that use them. Direct testing of private methods is generally discouraged as it can break encapsulation.
- **Alternative:** If necessary, use reflection (in languages that support it) or refactor the code to make private methods more testable.

**Example:** Test the public method that relies on a private method to verify that the private logic is working correctly through its impact on the public method’s behavior.

### **8. Improving Code Coverage in Unit Tests**

- **Definition:** Code coverage measures the percentage of code executed by your unit tests.
- **Strategies:**
    - **Identify Gaps:** Use coverage tools to identify untested parts of the code and add tests to cover these gaps.
    - **Focus on Critical Paths:** Prioritize coverage for critical functionality and business logic.
    - **Refactor Code:** Improve testability by refactoring complex code into smaller, testable units.

**Example:** Using a coverage tool like JaCoCo (Java) or [coverage.py](http://coverage.py/) (Python) to identify untested code paths and writing additional tests to cover them.

### **9. Refactoring Unit Tests**

- **Definition:** Refactoring unit tests involves improving the structure and quality of test code without changing its functionality.
- **Purpose:** To make tests more maintainable, readable, and efficient.
- **Techniques:**
    - **Extract Common Code:** Move repeated test setup or assertions into shared methods or test fixtures.

## **Integration Testing**

### **1. Understanding Integration Testing**

- **Definition:** Integration testing is a level of software testing where individual units or components are combined and tested as a group. The goal is to identify defects that occur when units interact with each other.
- **Purpose:** To verify that different modules or services work together correctly, ensuring that integrated components produce the expected results when interacting.
- **Types of Integration Testing:**
    - **Big Bang Integration Testing:** All components are integrated simultaneously and tested together. It's efficient but can make it difficult to isolate and debug issues.
    - **Incremental Integration Testing:** Components are integrated and tested one at a time until the entire system is tested. It can be done in two approaches:
        - **Top-Down:** Integration testing begins with top-level modules and proceeds downwards.
        - **Bottom-Up:** Integration testing starts with the lowest-level modules and proceeds upwards.
    - **Hybrid/Sandwich:** A combination of top-down and bottom-up approaches, where testing is done at multiple levels concurrently.

**Example:** In an e-commerce application, after unit testing the user login, product catalog, and shopping cart individually, integration testing would involve testing the flow from logging in to adding products to the cart and checking out.

### **2. Integration Testing Tools**

- **JUnit/TestNG (Java):** While primarily used for unit testing, these frameworks can also be used for integration testing by combining multiple units.
- **JUnit 5 + Spring Test (Java):** Ideal for testing Spring applications, allowing for integration tests with full context loading.

### **3. Mocking and Stubbing in API Integration**

- **Mocking:**
    - **Definition:** Mocking involves creating a fake version of a component or service to simulate its behavior during testing. Mocks are used to verify that a component interacts with its dependencies in the expected way.
    - **Usage:** Commonly used in API integration tests to simulate external services or APIs that are not available during testing.
    - **Example:** Mocking a payment gateway API to test how your application handles payment success and failure scenarios without relying on the actual payment gateway.
- **Stubbing:**
    - **Definition:** Stubbing involves providing predetermined responses to method calls made to a dependency. Stubs are simpler than mocks and are typically used to isolate the unit under test.
    - **Usage:** Used in integration testing when you need to provide controlled responses from external APIs or services.
    - **Example:** Creating a stub for a weather API that always returns sunny weather to test how your application displays weather data.

### **4. Simulating External Services in Integration Tests**

- **Definition:** Simulating external services involves creating fake or dummy implementations of external services your application depends on, allowing you to test how your application interacts with these services.
- **Techniques:**
    - **Service Virtualization:** Tools like WireMock or MockServer are used to create virtualized services that mimic the behavior of real external services, including their APIs, responses, and behavior under different conditions.
    - **Local Stubs/Mocks:** Using local code or libraries to simulate the behavior of external services. This is simpler but may not fully replicate the service's complexity.
    - **Docker Containers:** Running instances of external services in Docker containers to create controlled environments for integration testing.
    - **Network Simulation:** Tools like Toxiproxy can be used to simulate network conditions like latency, downtime, or packet loss during integration testing.

**Example:** Using WireMock to simulate a third-party API for payment processing, allowing you to test how your application handles different payment outcomes without needing access to the actual API.

### **5. Integration Testing in Microservices Architecture**

- **Challenges:** Microservices architecture introduces unique challenges for integration testing, including the complexity of service interactions, network dependencies, and distributed systems.
- **Approaches:**
    - **Contract Testing:** Ensures that services interact correctly by verifying that the requests and responses conform to a shared contract (e.g., using tools like Pact).
    - **API Gateway Testing:** Testing the integration of services through the API gateway, ensuring that requests are routed correctly and services respond as expected.
    - **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:** Testing the entire workflow involving multiple services, from request initiation to final response, to ensure the system works as a whole.
    - **Service Mesh Testing:** In environments using a service mesh (e.g., Istio), testing can include verifying service-to-service communication, load balancing, and network policies.
    - **Environment Parity:** Ensuring the test environment closely mirrors the production environment, possibly using containers or Kubernetes for environment consistency.

**Example:** In a micro services-based e-commerce platform, integration testing might involve testing the interaction between the order service, payment service, and inventory service to ensure that placing an order correctly updates the inventory and processes payment.

    - **Definition:** A technique that uses virtualized services to simulate the behavior of complex systems during testing. Service virtualization replicates the behavior, data, and performance characteristics of real services.
    - **Example:** Using tools like Parasoft Virtualize or WireMock to simulate third-party services that are difficult to access during testing, allowing for end-to-end testing of dependent systems.

### **9. What is API Versioning?**

- **Definition:** API versioning is the practice of managing changes to an API over time by assigning version numbers or labels to different iterations of the API. This allows developers to make updates or changes to an API without breaking existing client integrations.
- **Purpose:** To ensure backward compatibility and provide a clear path for upgrading APIs while maintaining support for older versions.

**Example:** Introducing a new version of an API (`v2`) with improved features while still supporting the existing version (`v1`) for legacy clients.

### **10. How to Implement API Versioning and Backward Compatibility**

- **Versioning Strategies:**
    - **URL Path Versioning:** Include the version number in the URL path.
        - **Example:** `https://api.example.com/v1/users` vs. `https://api.example.com/v2/users`
    - **Query Parameter Versioning:** Specify the version number as a query parameter.
        - **Example:** `https://api.example.com/users?version=1`
    - **Header Versioning:** Use custom headers to specify the API version.
        - **Example:** `GET /users` with `Accept: application/vnd.example.v1+json`
    - **Content Negotiation:** Use the `Accept` header to request a specific version of the API.
        - **Example:** `Accept: application/vnd.example.v1+json`
- **Ensuring Backward Compatibility:**
    - **Deprecation Policy:** Gradually phase out old versions with a clear deprecation notice and a transition period.
    - **Maintain Multiple Versions:** Continue supporting older versions while encouraging users to upgrade to the latest version.

## **Smoke Testing**

### **1. What is Smoke Testing?**

- **Definition:** Smoke testing, also known as "build verification testing," is a type of preliminary testing that ensures the basic and critical functionalities of an application work correctly. It is often performed after a new build or version of the software is released to verify that the most crucial aspects of the application are functioning as expected.
- **Purpose:** The primary goal of smoke testing is to catch major issues early in the development cycle, preventing the need for more extensive testing on a build that is fundamentally broken. If the smoke test fails, the build is rejected, and no further testing is conducted until the issues are resolved.

**Example:** After a new build of a web application, a smoke test might involve checking if the application launches successfully, if users can log in, and if the main pages load without errors.

### **2. Creating Effective Smoke Test Suites**

- **Identify Critical Functionality:** Focus on the most critical and essential features of the application. This includes the core functions that are necessary for the application to operate.
    - **Example:** For an e-commerce site, critical functionalities might include user login, product search, adding items to the cart, and checking out.
- **Keep It Simple and Quick:** Smoke tests should be quick to execute, focusing on breadth rather than depth. Avoid comprehensive testing at this stage; instead, cover a wide range of functionality at a high level.
    - **Example:** Instead of testing all payment options in detail, a smoke test might just verify that the payment page loads correctly and that a sample transaction can be initiated.
- **Automate the Smoke Tests:** Wherever possible, automate the smoke tests to ensure they can be run quickly and consistently with every new build. Automation tools like Selenium, JUnit, or Postman (for APIs) can be used.
    - **Example:** Using Selenium to automate the smoke test of a login page, ensuring that the page loads, the form can be submitted, and a user can log in successfully.
- **Ensure Coverage of Key Paths:** Make sure that the smoke test suite covers the main user flows and key paths of the application. This includes all the critical functionalities that, if broken, would render the application unusable.
    - **Example:** In a banking application, the smoke test suite might include checking account balance retrieval, fund transfers, and bill payments.
- **Regular Updates:** Continuously update the smoke test suite as new features are added or critical areas of the application change. Ensure that the smoke tests remain relevant to the current state of the application.
    - **Example:** If a new authentication method (e.g., OAuth) is introduced, the smoke test suite should be updated to include a test for this feature.

### **3. Smoke Testing for APIs**

- **Definition:** Smoke testing for APIs involves verifying that the core and critical API endpoints are functioning correctly. This is typically a high-level check to ensure that the API is available, responds correctly, and handles requests without major errors.
- **Key Areas to Test:**
    - **API Availability:** Verify that the API server is up and running, and the main endpoints can be accessed.
    - **Basic Functionality:** Test the most critical endpoints to ensure they return the expected responses with valid inputs.
    - **Error Handling:** Ensure that the API correctly handles invalid requests, such as incorrect parameters or unauthorized access.
    - **Response Status Codes:** Check that the API returns the correct HTTP status codes (e.g., 200 for success, 404 for not found, 500 for server errors).

**Example:** For a weather API, smoke testing might involve checking that the endpoint for retrieving weather data for a specific city is accessible, returns a `200 OK` status, and provides the expected data structure.

**Tools for Smoke Testing APIs:**

- **Postman:** Ideal for manually running smoke tests on APIs. Postman allows you to create and run collections of requests to verify API functionality quickly.
- **Newman (Postman CLI):** Used for automating Postman collections, making it easier to integrate smoke tests into CI/CD pipelines.

### **3. Smoke Testing vs. Sanity Testing**

- **Purpose:**
    - **Smoke Testing:** Performed to verify whether the critical functionalities of an application are working after a new build. It is a high-level check to determine whether the build is stable enough for further testing.
    - **Sanity Testing:** Focuses on verifying specific functionalities or bug fixes in a new build. It ensures that particular changes work correctly before proceeding with more detailed testing.
- **Scope:**
    - **Smoke Testing:** Broad and shallow. It covers a wide range of functionalities at a high level, without delving into details.
    - **Sanity Testing:** Narrow and deep. It focuses on specific areas of functionality or code changes, providing a more in-depth examination of those areas.
- **When Performed:**
    - **Smoke Testing:** Conducted early in the testing process, typically after a new build is deployed, to ensure basic functionality is intact.
    - **Sanity Testing:** Conducted after receiving a build with specific changes or bug fixes, focusing on those particular areas to verify that the changes work as intended.
- **Automation:**
    - **Smoke Testing:** Often automated due to its repetitive and broad nature, allowing it to be run quickly after every build.
    - **Sanity Testing:** Can be automated but is often performed manually, especially when the changes are specific and need a detailed check.
- **Outcome:**
    - **Smoke Testing:** If smoke testing fails, the build is considered unstable, and no further testing is conducted.
    - **Sanity Testing:** If sanity testing fails, it indicates that the specific functionality or bug fix is not working as expected, and the build may be rejected or sent back for further development.

**Example:** After a new build of a web application, smoke testing might check that the application launches, users can log in, and the main pages load. If a bug in the user profile update feature is fixed, sanity testing would only focus on verifying that the bug is resolved and that the profile update works as expected.

- **Defect Triage:**
    - **Definition:** Defect triage is a process where defects are reviewed, prioritized, and assigned for resolution. This involves collaboration between testers, developers, and project managers to decide the urgency and importance of fixing each defect.
    - **Process:** During triage meetings, each defect is discussed, and decisions are made on whether it should be fixed immediately, deferred to a later release, or closed if it’s a non-issue.
- **Resolution and Retesting:**
    - Once a defect is resolved by the development team, it is returned to the testing team for retesting. Retesting ensures that the defect is indeed fixed and that the fix has not introduced new issues (regression testing).
    - **Verification:** After successful retesting, the defect is marked as closed. If the defect still persists or if new issues are found, the defect is reopened and sent back to the development team for further investigation.
- **Reporting and Analysis:**
    - **Defect Reports:** Detailed defect reports are generated to provide insights into the number of defects, their severity, and the areas of the application most affected. These reports help in assessing the quality of the system and in making informed decisions about the release.
    - **Root Cause Analysis:** Analyzing defects helps identify the underlying causes of defects, such as code issues, requirement gaps, or testing oversights. Addressing these root causes can prevent similar defects in the future.

**Example:** During system testing of a payroll system, a defect is identified where the system incorrectly calculates overtime pay. The defect is logged in JIRA, triaged as a high-priority issue, and assigned to a developer. After the fix is implemented, the tester retests the functionality to verify the defect is resolved, ensuring the calculation is now correct.

    - **Switching Between Tabs:** Using `driver.getWindowHandles()` to get all open windows/tabs and then switching between them.
    
    **Example:** Opening a new tab, switching to it, performing an action, and then switching back.
    

### **20. How to Handle Multiple Windows in Selenium?**

- **Overview:** Handling multiple windows involves managing multiple browser instances, switching between them, and closing them as needed.
- **Steps:**
    - Open multiple windows or tabs using `driver.get("URL")` or JavaScript.
    - Switch between windows using their handles.
    - Perform actions in the newly opened window or tab.
    - Close the window or switch back to the original one.
    
    **Example:** Switching between a parent and child window using:
    
    ```java
    for (String handle : driver.getWindowHandles()) {
        driver.switchTo().window(handle);
    }
    
    ```
    

### **21. Handling Dynamic Content and AJAX Calls in Selenium**

    - **Page Object Model:** Encapsulate page-specific functionality and elements within a page class.
    
    **Example:** Using Page Factory to create a login page class:
    
    ```java
    public class LoginPage {
        @FindBy(id = "username")
        WebElement usernameField;
    
        @FindBy(id = "password")
        WebElement passwordField;
    
        @FindBy(id = "loginButton")
        WebElement loginButton;
    
        public LoginPage(WebDriver driver) {
            PageFactory.initElements(driver, this);
        }
    
        public void login(String username, String password) {
            usernameField.sendKeys(username);
            passwordField.sendKeys(password);

- **Techniques:**
    - **Alerts:** Use `driver.switchTo().alert()` to interact with alerts.
    - **Pop-ups:** Locate and interact with pop-up elements using standard locator strategies.
    - **Notifications:** Access and interact with system notifications if required by your test scenario.
    
    **Example:** Handling a confirmation alert in an iOS app using:
    
    ```java
    Alert alert = driver.switchTo().alert();
    alert.accept();  // or alert.dismiss();
    
    ```
    

### **12. Automating Mobile Web Browsers**

- **Overview:** Appium can also be used to automate mobile web browsers, allowing you to test responsive web applications.
- **Techniques:**

    import static org.junit.Assert.assertEquals;
    
    public class CalculatorTest {
    
        @Test
        public void testAdd() {
            Calculator calc = new Calculator();
            int result = calc.add(2, 3);
            assertEquals(5, result);
        }
    }
    
    ```
    

### **5. Test Classes and Methods**

- **Annotations:**
    - **@Test:** Marks a method as a test method.
    - **@Before:** Runs before each test method to set up the test environment.
    - **@After:** Runs after each test method to clean up.
    - **@BeforeClass:** Runs once before all test methods in the class (for static methods).
    - **@AfterClass:** Runs once after all test methods in the class (for static methods).
    
    **Example:**
    
    ```java
    @Before
    public void setUp() {
        // Set up code
    }
    
    @Test
    public void testMethod() {
        // Test code
    }
    
    @After
    public void tearDown() {
        // Cleanup code
    }
    
    ```
    

### **6. Assertions in JUnit**

- **Overview:** Assertions are methods that check whether a condition is true. If the condition is false, the test fails.
- **Common Assertions:**
    - **assertEquals(expected, actual):** Checks if two values are equal.
    - **assertTrue(condition):** Checks if a condition is true.
    - **assertFalse(condition):** Checks if a condition is false.
    - **assertNull(object):** Checks if an object is null.
    - **assertNotNull(object):** Checks if an object is not null.
    - **assertArrayEquals(expectedArray, actualArray):** Checks if two arrays are equal.
    
    **Example:**
    
    ```java
    @Test
    public void testAssertEquals() {
        String expected = "Hello";
        String actual = "Hello";
        assertEquals(expected, actual);
    }
    
    ```
    

### **7. Test Lifecycle in JUnit**

    - **@AfterClass:** Runs once after all tests in the class.
    
    **Example:**
    
    ```java
    public class MyTests {
    
        @BeforeClass
        public static void initAll() {
            // Runs once before all tests
        }
    
        @Before
        public void init() {
            // Runs before each test
        }
    
        @Test

- **Common Annotations:**
    - **@Mock:** Creates a mock object.
    - **@InjectMocks:** Injects the mocks into the tested object.
    - **@Before:** Initializes the mocks before each test.
    
    **Example:**
    
    ```java
    import org.junit.Before;
    import org.junit.Test;
    import org.mockito.InjectMocks;
    import org.mockito.Mock;
    import org.mockito.MockitoAnnotations;
    
    public class ServiceTest {
    
        @Mock
        private Dependency dependency;
    
        @InjectMocks
        private Service service;
    
        @Before
        public void init() {
            MockitoAnnotations.openMocks(this);
        }
    
        @Test
        public void testServiceMethod() {
            when(dependency.someMethod()).thenReturn("Mocked Result");
            String result = service.serviceMethod();
            assertEquals("Mocked Result", result);
        }
    }
    
    ```
    

### **10. Exception Testing in JUnit**

- **Overview:** JUnit allows you to test whether a specific exception is thrown by a method.
- **Techniques:**
    - **@Test(expected = Exception.class):** Specifies the exception that is expected to be thrown.
    - **try-catch with fail():** Manually catch exceptions and use `fail()` to indicate failure if an exception isn’t thrown.
    
    **Example:**
    
    ```java
    @Test(expected = IllegalArgumentException.class)
    public void testException() {
        Calculator calc = new Calculator();
        calc.divide(1, 0);  // Should throw IllegalArgumentException
    }
    
    ```
    

### **11. JUnit Best Practices**

- **Principles:**
    - **Isolate Tests:** Each test should be independent, avoiding shared state that could lead to flaky tests.
    - **Use Meaningful Names:** Test names should clearly describe what they are testing.
    - **Keep Tests Simple:** Tests should focus on a single behavior or condition.
    - **Clean Up Resources:** Always release resources (e.g., files, database connections) in `@After` methods.
    - **Test Edge Cases:** Ensure your tests cover edge cases and potential failure points.
    
    **Example:** Writing well-named, isolated tests that follow these best practices.

### **20. Component Testing with Cypress**

- **Overview:** Cypress supports testing individual components in isolation, especially useful in modern front-end frameworks like React and Vue.
- **Usage:** Set up component testing using Cypress’s Component Testing feature, configuring your framework-specific test runner.
    
    **Example:** Running a React component test within Cypress.
    
    Consider you have a React component called `MyButton` that you want to test. This component is a simple button that accepts a `label` prop and an `onClick` handler.
    
    **Component Code (`MyButton.js`):**
    
    ```jsx
    javascriptCopy code
    import React from 'react';
    
    const MyButton = ({ label, onClick }) => {
      return (
        <button onClick={onClick}>
          {label}
        </button>
      );
    };
    
    export default MyButton;
    
    ```
    
    **Component Test Code (`MyButton.test.js`):**
    
    ```jsx
    import React from 'react';
    import MyButton from '../../src/MyButton';
    
    describe('MyButton Component', () => {
      it('renders correctly', () => {
        cy.mount(<MyButton label="Click me" />);
        cy.get('button').should('contain.text', 'Click me');
      });
    
      it('triggers onClick event', () => {
        const onClickSpy = cy.spy().as('onClick');
        cy.mount(<MyButton label="Click me" onClick={onClickSpy} />);
        cy.get('button').click();
        cy.get('@onClick').should('have.been.calledOnce');
      });
    });
    
    ```
    
    **Explanation:**
    
    - **Test 1:** Verifies that the button renders with the correct label. Cypress mounts the `MyButton` component and checks if the button element contains the text "Click me".
    - **Test 2:** Checks if the `onClick` handler is called when the button is clicked. Cypress mounts the component with a spy function for `onClick`, simulates a button click, and verifies that the spy function was called once.

### **21. Cypress Best Practices**

- **Best Practices:**
    - Keep tests atomic and focused.
    - Use data attributes for selectors.
    - Avoid using `cy.wait()` with arbitrary timeouts; prefer `.should()` for waiting.
    - Mock external services to reduce dependencies on third-party APIs.
    - Regularly clean up and refactor tests to maintain clarity and efficiency.
    
    **Example:** Refactoring a Cypress test suite to follow best practices.
